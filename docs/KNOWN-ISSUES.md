# Known issues

Things measured, reproduced, and not yet fixed. An issue leaves this file when
it is fixed or when it is shown not to be real — not when it stops being
convenient.

## 1. ethusd's reconstructed book develops holes near the touch

**Found** 2026-09-09, on the 8-hour ethusd capture (1.62 M orders, 5,032 trades).

**Symptom.** 27.6% of prints landed *in front of* the touch we had
reconstructed: a taker buy printing below our best ask. That cannot happen
against a correct book — it means our best ask was worse than the real one, so
a level was missing.

**What it is not.** Two guesses, both disproved by measurement:

- *The aggressor's side is mislabelled.* No. The synthetic path did have that
  bug and it was fixed; the capture path takes the taker side straight from the
  feed, and btcusd through identical code reports 4.2%.
- *The price window is too narrow.* No. Widening `--band-pct` from 0.02 to 0.10
  left the count **identical at 1922**, and the touch then had 41%/49% headroom.

**What it is.** The distance histogram settles it:

| in front by | prints | share |
|---|---|---|
| 1 tick | 623 | 32% |
| 2–4 | 117 | 6% |
| 5–16 | 279 | 15% |
| **17+** | **903** | **47%** |

A one-tick gap is a message-ordering race between the `live_orders` and
`live_trades` channels — the delete reaches us before the print that caused it,
so the touch has already moved. That is a third of them and is not fixable from
the capture.

The other two thirds are levels genuinely absent from the book. At those moments
the reconstruction showed a spread of 17+ ticks on an instrument that sits at
one tick, so the touch was empty and the nearest level we knew about was far
away.

**Unverified hunch, recorded as a hunch.** ethusd moved 2.0% across the capture
against btcusd's 0.9%, so more of its range was price territory the book had
never seen. `BitstampConfig::seed_guard` also refuses to seed levels within 0.3%
of the snapshot touch, so that band starts empty and must fill from the stream.
Neither is measured. Do not repeat the mistake above and act on this before
testing it.

**What it costs.** More than the one measurement first claimed here. That
claim was made by reading which column `trades.dist_ticks` feeds, and it missed
that a book with holes reports a wider spread than the market has:

| | clean 10-min capture | 8-hour capture |
|---|---|---|
| spread at one tick | 92% | **60%** |
| mid steps kept by the `max_spread` filter | 85% | **61%** |

So the spread distribution is degraded and 39% of mid steps are discarded. What
survives is sound — the median mid move is 1 tick, P(up) 1.6%, and the imbalance
signal is the best measured on any instrument, running 0.7% to 2.7% monotonically
across the five buckets. ethusd still passes both usability checks. But it is
not true that only `level_ratio` was affected.

**No workaround for the level ratio.** Taking it from btcusd was the first plan
and it does not work: btcusd's own touch teleports, so its levels are just as
unreliable, and it reports 30.8% / 29.2% / 29.1% across three levels — flat,
when penetration must fall with depth. ethusd reports 62.1% / 61.4% / 61.0%.
`tools/mdp_params.py` now rejects a ratio that is flat across levels or above
0.5 for exactly this reason. Neither eight-hour capture measures it; it must be
given to `solve` explicitly with `--level-ratio` and defended.

**How to check a fix.** `stats --capture-dir <dir>` prints the share and the
histogram. A fix moves the 5–16 and 17+ rows toward zero; the 1-tick row should
not move, because that one is the channel race and no book change touches it.

## 2. The MDP prices a touch quote as a guaranteed loser on real data

**Found** 2026-09-09, solving ethusd from the 8-hour capture. The policy quotes
one tick behind the touch in **81.8% of states and at the touch in none** — the
same pathology fixed earlier against the simulator, arrived at from a different
direction.

**The arithmetic, from the numbers the solve printed.** Averaged across
imbalance, P(mid moves) is 2.9% an epoch while P(fill at the touch, alone in the
queue) is 0.141% — **moves are 21x more likely than fills**. A touch quote taken
by a move earns `edge_ticks[0]` = 0.5 and then has `move_ticks` = 1.0 applied
against the resulting inventory, so each one is worth −0.5:

| | ticks/epoch |
|---|---|
| at the touch | 2.9% x (−0.50) + 0.141% x (+0.50) = **−0.0138** |
| one tick behind | 0.0141% x (+1.50) = **+0.0002** |

Nothing about the policy is wrong given those inputs. One of the inputs is.

**Two candidates. Both measurable. Neither yet measured.**

1. `move_ticks` is 1.0 here against 0.5 on the clean ten-minute capture, and it
   comes from the same degraded book as issue 1 — 60% of the time at one tick
   against 92%. If the true figure is 0.5 the move-fill is break-even, not −0.5,
   and the fill income decides it.
2. `expand()` charges the FULL move against every move-fill. The markout
   measured on this very capture says the mid moves against the passive side
   **33% of the time**, not always. Charging a certain loss where the data shows
   a one-in-three chance is a different error, in the same direction, and it
   does not need issue 1 to be true.

Note what is NOT a candidate: `taken_by_move()` firing for a quote at the touch.
That looks like an over-assumption in a book where 99.7% of removals are
cancels, and it is not one — a maker does not cancel its own quote, so for the
touch to move past our price our order must have been taken.

**What it does not affect.** The Phase 5 acceptance test, which runs on the
simulator, where the same solver produces a policy that quotes at the touch in
73% of states. This is the real-instrument table only, and that table is a
demonstration artefact.

**Do not fix by picking one.** Measure `move_ticks` on a book without issue 1's
holes, and separately measure P(mid move is adverse | our quote was taken), and
let the two numbers say which it is.
